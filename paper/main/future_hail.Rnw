\abstract{Hailstorms cause damage across the globe, but changes to hailstorms in
a warming climate are not well quantified. We applied three hail proxies to an
ensemble of global model projections to quantify changes in the frequency of
hail-prone conditions worldwide. Changes were divergent, with results depending
on proxy treatment of temperature. Uncertainty on hail projections remains high,
especially in the tropics. However, in projections with 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{}
of mean global warming, ensemble-mean hail-prone conditions shifted poleward,
with decreases in hail hazard across the mid-latitudes and increases in colder
regions. We calculated the resulting effects for 26 crop types. With fixed
exposure and vulnerability, hail risk was generally projected to increase for
winter crops such as wheat and decrease for summer crops such as maize. Poleward
shifts in hail hazard may attenuate any positive impacts of similar shifts in
crop regions under climate change.}

Hailstorms are a form of extreme weather that causes significant damage to
physical assets including crops. Hail and the storms that produce it are
expected to be affected by anthropogenic global warming, yet regional studies
using observations or projections show geographical inhomogeneities and there
remains high uncertainty on the details of any changes \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}.
Globally, hail observations are scarce \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, meaning global
climatologies generally rely on satellite data \cite{Bang_JAMC_2019} or
examination of environmental conditions in reanalyses using hail proxies
\cite{Prein_WCE_2018}. Here, we produced global projections of future hail
hazard using hail proxies applied to model output from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) \cite{Eyring_GMD_2016} in a per-degree
framework, and used them to analyse projected changes in hail frequency and
resulting changes in hail risk to crops.

Because hailstorms are hard to observe and model owing to their small spatial
size and relative rarity \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, proxies that detect
hail-prone atmospheric conditions are often used in climatological studies. Hail
proxies rely on detecting the atmospheric ``ingredients'' required for hail to
form. Hailstones form by accretion of supercooled liquid water onto ice embryos
suspended in the updraft of a thunderstorm, until they become too heavy to
support, after which they fall while melting on their descent through warmer air
\cite{Knight_2001}. Hailstorm ingredients are usually considered to include, at
a minimum, atmospheric instability, for a thunderstorm with strong updrafts that
can support hail growth to form \cite{Brooks_AR_2003}, and vertical wind shear
(differences in horizontal wind by height) to ``organise'' the storm
\cite{Brooks_AR_2013} and influence hailstone trajectories \cite{Lin_JAS_2022}.
Instability--shear hail proxies are common \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}. Proxies
suffer, however, from the ``initiation problem'', in that storms rarely initiate
even in storm-prone conditions \cite{Tippett_CCCR_2015}.

Climate change is expected to affect the ingredients for hailstorms and thus the
frequency and severity of hailstorms themselves \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}. A
thermodynamic expectation is of three offsetting effects: first, increased
instability owing to a larger saturation deficit in a warmer atmosphere
\cite{Seeley_GRL_2015} leading to more storm initiation and stronger updrafts
that could support larger hailstones; second, increased melting of hailstones
owing to a warmer troposphere \cite{Prein_NCC_2020}, thus leading to a reduction
(or elimination \cite{Mahoney_NCC_2012}) of surface hail frequency; and third,
an overall decrease in vertical wind shear \cite{Brooks_AR_2013} that is often
outweighed by changes in instability \cite{Trapp_GRL_2009} or may not apply
locally \cite{Radler_npjCAS_2019}. The broad thermodynamic expectation is thus
of a reduction in surface hail frequency combined with an increase in severity
when hail does reach the Earth's surface \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}. However,
regional studies show large geographical heterogeneity in trends in hail
frequency, owing in part to offsetting in these climate change effects and in
part to dynamical changes meaning that ingredient changes are not spatially
uniform, while hail severity is generally expected to increase
\cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}.

Here, we applied three globally realistic hail proxies to an ensemble of eight
global projections from CMIP6, to examine projections of the frequency of
hail-prone conditions globally. We used a per-degree framework
\cite{Lepore_EF_2021} for simpler comparisons between models. As a sensitivity
study, we investigated the effects of projected changes on hail-prone
proportions of time-invariant crop growing seasons for 26 different crops. For
details of the simulations and proxies used, refer to ``Online methods'' and the
supplementary information. Our work shows that, generally, hailstorm frequency
is projected to shift poleward, with decreases in warmer environments but
increases in cooler environments in future, driven primarily by changes in
convective instability. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the projected
changes would increase hail occurrence risk to winter crops, while decreasing
occurrence risk for summer crops.

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection*{Comparison to ERA5 for the historical period}

Figure \ref{fig:cmip_era_comparison} shows a comparison between the multimodel,
multi-proxy mean of annual hail-prone days for the CMIP6 models, and the
multi-proxy mean of annual hail-prone days for the ERA5 reanalysis, for
1980--1999. While individual CMIP6 models produced a wide range of absolute
values of hail-prone days (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:historical_annual_means}), the locations of hail hotspots agreed
well between reanalysis and models. The models MPI-ESM1-2-HR and EC-Earth
produced similar numbers of hail-prone days to ERA5, while MIROC6, CMCC-CM2-SR5,
and CMCC-ESM2 showed moderately more and CNRM-CM6-1 and GISS-E2-1-G showed
significantly more hail-prone days than ERA5. Different proxies highlighted
similar geographical regions but differed in magnitudes of hail-prone days, with
the Significant Hail Parameter (SHIP) \cite{SPC_SHIP} producing the fewest, and
the Eccel proxy \cite{Eccel_IJC_2012} producing the greatest number of
hail-prone days, respectively. Given the models produced geographical agreement
but differences in absolute numbers of hail-prone days, we focus on changes in
multi-proxy, multimodel means in the rest of our analyses.

    (1980-1999) at 1 $\times$ 1 $^{\circ}$ resolution.}
    \label{fig:cmip_era_comparison}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Case studies of hail-prone day anomalies}
\label{sec:cases}

Monthly multi-proxy mean anomalies in hail-prone days derived using ERA5
reanalysis showed higher values for months with known occurrences of damaging
hailstorms. The proxies produced higher than climatological average numbers of
hail-prone days for February and March 2015 in northern and central India
(Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:anoms_India_2015}), regions that were affected
by hailstorms that caused major losses to wheat crops in this period
\citep{Chattopadhyay_Mausam_2017, Singh_CS_2017}. Similarly, the proxies
highlighted areas of central and southern Europe as particularly hail-prone in
June 2022 (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:anoms_Europe_2022}), when the
passage of two low-pressure systems caused high-loss hailstorm outbreaks across
these regions \citep{Pucik_2023}. The proxies also identified April 2015 and
October 2022 as unusually hail-prone months in northeast India and western
France, respectively; there were hailstorms reported in both regions during
these respective months \cite{Chattopadhyay_Mausam_2017, Pucik_2023}. These
case-study results increase our confidence in the ability of the multi-proxy
mean to identify hail-prone conditions worldwide, despite the individual proxies
having been trained using data from Australia \citep{Raupach_MWR_2023}, Italy
\citep{Eccel_IJC_2012}, and the United States \citep{SPC_SHIP}.

\subsection*{Changes in hail-prone days with warming}

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/main/change_annual_hail_days_abs}
    \caption{\textbf{Hail-prone conditions shift under warming projections.}
    Multi-proxy, multimodel mean changes in annual hail-prone days for 2 \degr{}
    (a) and 3 \degr{} (b) of global warming. Stippling shows regions in which at
    least 50\% of the model/proxy combinations agreed with the sign of the mean
    difference and also showed significant differences in the mean ($p < 0.05$
    on a t-test on two related samples).}
    \label{fig:future_changes_hail_days}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:future_changes_hail_days} shows multimodel, multi-proxy mean
changes in annual hail-prone days for 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} of global warming,
respectively. These changes are shown as relative differences zoomed to selected
land areas in Figure \ref{fig:future_changes_regional}. Changes were similar
between the two epochs, with a general increase in the change magnitude in the 3
\degr{} scenario. Changes generally agreed in sign across the Raupach proxy and
SHIP, while the pure instability--shear proxy of Eccel \cite{Eccel_IJC_2012}
produced contrasting increases across the tropics (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:hail_diffs_3C}) that lead to high uncertainty in the tropics,
especially in Asia and the Americas. The mean changes show an overall poleward
shift of hail-prone conditions under both warming scenarios, with increases in
hail-prone conditions frequency projected across land areas in central-north
Asia, New Zealand, the southeast of Australia, North America north of about
50\degg{} N, South America in the southern Pampas and west to the Andes, and
Europe north of about 60\degg{} N, in the vicinity of the Alps, and southeast of
the Black Sea. Decreases in hail-prone day frequency were projected in southeast
coastal areas of India and China, connecting in a band across mainland Southeast
Asia, northern Australia, the southeast United States and Mexico, southeast
South America east of the Andes between about 15\degg{} S and 30\degg{} S, and
most of Africa south of 15\degg{} N. Changes by season are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:hail_changes_by_season}, and show that the increases (decreases) shift
poleward in the cold (warm) season.

\subsection*{Projected changes in proxy ingredients}

Projections of storm-relevant properties showed almost uniform increases in
convective instability, with increases in extreme values of convective available
potential energy (CAPE) and lifted index (LI), and increasing convective
inhibition that may lead to more explosive development of severe storms
(Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_1}). Projections in
extremes in 0-6 km bulk wind shear (S06) showed decreases (mixed increases) in
the northern (southern) hemisphere (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_1}). Temperature-related ingredients increased
as expected in the warmer scenarios (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_2}). 

\subsection*{Drivers of the projected changes}

Figure \ref{fig:drivers} shows the main drivers of projected changes in this
study, shown as the difference between projected changes and changes when the
future values for single ingredients were de-biased. The ingredients driving the
changes depended on the proxy. Overall, increases in hail-prone environment
frequency were driven by instability increases, while reductions in hail-prone
environment frequency were driven by temperature-related ingredients. The sums
of changes across de-biased ingredients were close to the projected changes
where no ingredients were de-biased, indicating that these results explain most
of the projected changes, with the small differences that remain likely related
to interactions between ingredients. The large differences between the Eccel
proxy and the other proxies were caused by the instability--shear proxy reacting
to increases in instability without explicitly accounting for temperature
changes. Changes in SHIP were driven mainly by changes in the most-unstable
mixing ratio. In the Raupach proxy, increases in hail-prone days owing to
instability increases are offset by changes in melting level height and
$T_{500}$.

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/main/sig_drivers}
    \caption{\textbf{The main drivers of the projected changes.} All drivers are
    shown in Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:drivers}. All plots are multimodel
    means. Plots show the difference in hail prone days between historical and
    the 3C epoch for unchanged ingredients, minus the difference with the given
    ingredient de-biased in the 3C epoch. Red (blue) areas show where an
    ingredient added to (subtracted from) the projected change. Ingredients
    shown here are melting level height (MLH, a-d), mixed-layer CAPE (MLCAPE,

    (T500, m-p). ``Sum'' (q-t) shows sums across changes from all de-biased
    ingredients (column sums from Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:drivers}) and
    ``Ref'' (u-x) shows the projected changes per proxy when no ingredients were
    de-biased. Columns show hail proxies and the colour scale is in annual hail
    days.}
    \label{fig:drivers}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Changes in hail-prone proportions of cropping periods}

Figure \ref{fig:crop_changes} shows changes in the proportion of crop growing
time considered hail-prone, for 26 crops by world region. We use a new metric,
the hail-prone proportion of cropping season (HPP, the proportion of total
cropping days considered hail prone) to measure relative hail occurrence hazard
per crop for a given location. For the historic period, the African tropics
showed particularly high hail hazard for sorghum, millet, groundnuts/peanuts,
rice, soybeans, maize, and pulses (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:historic_crop_proportions}). Warming of 2\degr{} and 3\degr{} C was
projected to reduce HPP for these crops while increasing HPP for crops grown in
more poleward regions (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_3C}). 

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/main/crop_changes}
    \caption{\textbf{Distributions of significant changes in hail-prone crop
    proportion (HPP) by crop, epoch, and world region}. Regions are defined as

    multi-proxy mean changes in hail-prone proportion of cropping season (HPP),
    shown as a percentage of the multimodel, multi-proxy mean historical HPP.
    Significant changes are those for which at least 50\% of the model/proxy
    combinations agreed with the sign of the mean difference and also showed
    significant differences in the mean ($p < 0.05$ using Welch's t-test).
    Coloured boxes show interquartile ranges, whiskers show 10th-90th percentile
    ranges.}
    \label{fig:crop_changes}
\end{figure*}

In Africa, all crops were projected to experience fewer hail-prone days, with
regional increases not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_africa}). In Asia, (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_asia}), there were a range of responses for most crops,
with decreasing hail hazard in India and southeastern in China, but increases in
HPP across the north. Maize was projected to experience a greater hail hazard in
southeastern China but a lesser hazard in the northeast, while wheat and
rapeseed/canola showed strong increases in HPP in northeastern China. In Europe,
most significant changes were increases, with projected increases in HPP for
barley, fodder grasses, grapes/vine, maize, potatoes, pulses, rapeseed/canola,
rye, wheat, and other annual and perennial crops. The significant increases were
generally concentrated in a zonal band at around 60\degg{}N and in regions
around the Alps in Western Europe, an area to the southeast of the Black Sea,
and in southern Iran (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_europe}).
Increases in HPP for rye were heavily concentrated in Finland, Estonia, Latvia,
and the adjoining areas of Russia. In North America, there were significant
increases for barley and rye in particular, with regional increases in HPP for
these crops across the central and eastern USA. For other crops, there were
generally decreases in HPP projected in the southeast, with increases projected
in the northwest and across northern Canada (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_north_america}). In Oceania overall, barley was
projected to have increased hail hazard, albeit with a large range in projected
changes, while all other crops showed projected decreases in HPP. Significant
decreases in HPP were concentrated in Australia's northeast, while significant
increases were concentrated in a small region of southeast Australia and the
South Island of New Zealand (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_oceania}). In South America, all crops were projected
to have decreased overall hazard, except date palm and sugar beet which both
have small growing areas. However, regional changes show statistically
significant increases in HPP for several crops, for example maize and potatoes,
in a region of the southern Pampas and west to the Andes (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_south_america}).

Monthly changes for point locations (Supplementary Figures
\ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_af}--\ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_india}) highlight that the
crops with the greatest projected increases in risk were those with winter
cropping periods, while those with the greatest reductions in risk were those
that grow across summer periods. For example, in China, potatoes were projected
to have decreased risk during the cropping season of May to September, while
wheat was projected to have increased risk during its season from October to
April (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_as}). These plots also show
that uncertainty was higher for the summer months, with greater inter-model
spread and with the sign of the change disagreeing between proxies for some
months. Returning to the two case studies shown earlier, a region of southern
Europe near the Alps showed an overall increase in hail-prone proportion of
cropping season for potatoes, rye, and wheat, with proxy disagreement across the
summer months and agreement on increases from October to April (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_eu}). In India for rice, wheat and maize, there
were non-significant increases in cropping season hail-prone proportion across
the southern flank of the Himalaya, but decreases further south (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_india}).

\section*{Discussion}

We applied three hail proxies to an ensemble of eight global projections. The
proxy results were divergent, with the Raupach and SHIP proxies that take
temperature explicitly into account projecting decreases in hail-prone condition
frequency across the tropics, while the instability--shear proxy of Eccel
projected strong increases in these regions. This inconsistency is explained by
temperature changes: the Raupach proxy, in particular, has a strong feature
interaction where the height of the melting level affects the relative
importance of instability versus shear in the proxy \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023} (see
also Supplementary Material Section \ref{SM-sec:proxy-update}). The analysis of
drivers (Figure \ref{fig:drivers}) shows this interaction, with the Raupach
proxy less sensitive to instability in the tropics than in the mid-latitudes.
Instability--shear proxies have a tendency to overestimate hail probability in
the tropics, \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}, which motivated development of the Raupach
proxy. The disagreement between proxy projections means there remains high
uncertainty on projections on hail hazard changes, particularly in the tropics.

Our projections show broad poleward shifts in ensemble-mean hail-prone condition
occurrence frequency under 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} of warming, with, generally,
decreases in summer hail-prone day frequency and smaller increases in winter.
The increases are driven by changes in instability and offset by increases in
temperature. A sensitivity analysis on 26 crop types shows that winter crops are
most susceptible to increases in hail hazard while summer crops are most likely
to experience a reduction in hail hazard. It is interesting to compare our
results to those for the broader class of severe convective storms, which
includes thunderstorms that do not produce hail. Severe storm conditions are
generally projected to increase in frequency with global warming
\cite{Lepore_EF_2021}. Similar to the differences between the Eccel and
Raupach/SHIP proxies discussed above, our results indicate that changes in hail
conditions may differ from those in overall storm conditions because of
temperature changes -- that is, increasing hailstone melt in warmer conditions,
which is especially important for smaller hail \cite{Mahoney_NCC_2012}.

To put our global analysis of changes in hail hazard frequency under climate
change in context, here we show where our projections agree with or contradict
previous results \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, by region. In Asia, our results match
past decreases in hail occurrence found in stations concentrated in China's east
from 1980-2012 \cite{Li_JC_2016}, but contradict past decreases in hail events
reported in Mongolia (1993-2013) \cite{Lkhamjav_APJAS_2017}. In Australia, our
significant projections continue observed trends: hail-prone conditions in
reanalysis (1979-2021) have increased in the southeast and southwest of the
country with decreases across the north and centre \cite{Raupach_npjCAS_2023}
(our non-significant projected decreases in frequency in the southwest
contradict these past trends). Projections for small regions in the southeast
have shown no trends in hail losses for doubled CO2 concentrations
\cite{McMaster_CC_1999}. A decrease in frequency in point locations in southwest
Victoria was projected when comparing 1980-2000 to 2040-2060
\cite{Niall_IJC_2005}, although the decreases were based on decreases in
instability that do not agree with more recent analyses \cite{Allen_JC_2014}.

In North America, past trends show a mixed picture \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, but
our projections align with some previous results: hailstorm frequency increased
in Alberta, Canada from 1982-1993 compared to 1977-1982 \cite{Etkin_IJC_1999},
there increases in frequency the central Rockies with overall USA decreases
close to 2000 (although increases were noted in the high plains and southeast,
contradicting our results) \cite{Changnon_JC_2000}, and a poleward shift was
found in hail reports since 2000 in the Eastern United States
\cite{Liu_ERL_2024}. Regional projections for North America comparing 1971-2000
to 2041-2070 have shown decreases in frequency overall and especially in the
east and southeast \cite{Brimelow_NCC_2017} and a near elimination of surface
hail in Colorado \cite{Mahoney_NCC_2012}, agreeing with our projections. Severe
hail frequency in North America is generally projected to increase
\cite{Trapp_JC_2019}, although summer decreases in severe hail frequency in the
east are projected \cite{Trapp_JC_2019}. In South America, there are few trend
studies and no other projections \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}; in Argentina our
significant projections contradict observed decreases in the centre and east
over 1960-2008, although there is geographical variability in observed trends in
Argentina \cite{Mezher_AR_2012}.

In Europe, our results showed significant projected increases to the north of
the Alps, agreeing with past increases in Switzerland in insurance data
(1949-1993) \cite{Willemse_1995}, Switzerland (1959-2022)
\cite{Wilhelm_NHESS_2024} in reanalyses, and Southern Germany (1986-2004) in
insurance records \cite{Kunz_IJC_2009}. Much of the rest of southern and central
Europe showed non-significant changes in our analysis, which aligns with the
wide variety of observed trends and corresponding high uncertainty for both
trends and projections in this region \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}. In Germany,
where our results were non-significant, regional projections to 2050 have shown
increases in hail-related weather types \cite{Kapsch_JGRA_2012} and an increase
in hail potential in the northwest and south \cite{Mohr_JGRA_2015}. Likewise in
central Italy our results were non-significant while a previous regional
projection to 2040 showed an increase in annual hail frequency
\cite{Piani_NHESS_2005}. Increased melting in Atlantic France is projected to
reduce hailstone numbers \cite{Dessens_AR_2015}. Severe hail frequency in Europe
is generally projected to increase by 2100 \cite{Radler_npjCAS_2019} with model
disagreement on instability trends over the United Kingdom
\cite{Sanderson_IJC_2015}.

In our work we have used CMIP6 projections that include changes in atmospheric
circulations, thus avoiding a purely thermodynamic approach. However, we note
that there is generally low confidence in how changes in dynamics affect extreme
events \cite{IPCC_2021_WGI_Ch_11}, and for the broader class of severe
convective storms changes in reanalysis periods \cite{Taszarek_npj_2021} can be
of different sign to projected changes \cite{Lepore_EF_2021}, which may be
partly explained by uncertainty introduced by changes in atmospheric
circulation. Proxies trained in one region cannot be assumed to be perfectly
applicable globally since storm properties differ by location
\cite{Brooks_AR_2003, Raupach_MWR_2023}. However, the Raupach proxy is
specifically designed to take spatial variability in storm conditions into
account by using the melting level height, and have been shown to perform
reasonably across the Australian continent which contains a wide variety of
storm environments \cite{Raupach_npjCAS_2023}, and the multi-proxy means were
able to identify particularly hail-prone conditions in case studies in areas in
which the proxies used here were not trained. Although we show proxy results
globally, we note the proxies used were trained using land-based reports
\cite{Raupach_MWR_2023, Eccel_IJC_2012} and there is uncertainty in the
occurrence of hail in maritime storms \citep{Knight_2001}.

Our results showing the effects of the projected changes on hail-prone cropping
periods contribute to understanding climate impacts on global food production.
Most previous studies have concentrated on temperature, precipitation, and CO2
changes, and neglect infrequent but high-impact extreme weather such as
hailstorms \cite{Jagermeyr_NF_2021}. A limitation to our approach is that the
cropping periods we consider are stationary in time and relatively coarse, so
our analysis of crop changes should be taken as a sensitivity study rather than
projections of changes in crop damage or yield. Suitable growing regions and
cropping periods may also shift poleward with warming \cite{Franke_GCB_2022}
with some positive impacts on yields \cite{Jagermeyr_NF_2021}. Our study shows
that similar shifts in hail hazard may attenuate any positive impact on crop
yields in a warming world. For maize, an important staple grown in tropical
regions, a potential reduction in hail hazard would only lessen the projected
severe reduction in yield owing to increasing temperatures
\cite{Jagermeyr_NF_2021}. It is also important to note that the timing of hail
events within the broad cropping season strongly influences possible crop
damage, because crop vulnerability to hail depends on the growth stage
\cite{Dhillon_CJPS_2021}. Future analyses should take projected changes in
cropping season and growth stages into account. 

Our results show large areas of projected reductions in hail-prone day
frequency. However, given proxy limitations, we do not examine changes in
hailstorm severity or hailstone size. Projected increases in atmospheric
instability (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_1}) in regions
in which sufficient moisture is available would generally be expected to
increase generation of large hailstones that could survive melting to the
surface \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, meaning that even where frequency is projected
to reduce, severity may increase. A coincident decrease of small hail and
increase of large hail aligns with hail size end-of-century projections for the
USA \cite{Gensini_npjCAS_2024}. It is likely that global severe hail projections
would differ significantly from the ``any hail'' projections shown here.

\subsection*{Data}

A filtering approach was used to select models from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) \cite{Eyring_GMD_2016}. We selected
models that contained variables required to calculate convective indices: air
temperature at the surface (\texttt{tas}) and by model level (\texttt{ta}), wind
vectors at the surface (\texttt{uas} and \texttt{vas}) and by level (\texttt{ua}
and \texttt{va}), specific humidity at the surface (\texttt{huss}) and by level
(\texttt{hus}), and surface pressure (\texttt{ps}). We filtered for models with
a temporal resolution at least as fine as six-hourly (those with ``table IDs''
of \texttt{3hr} or \texttt{6hrLev}), and models that were available for both
historical and SSP5-8.5 experiments (``experiment IDs'' of \texttt{historical}
or \texttt{ssp585}). Further, the models had to be available in the National
Computational Infrastructure (NCI) node of the Earth System Grid Federation
(ESGF), and had to cover the required epochs. The resulting CMIP6 models, that
we used here, are detailed in Supplementary Table \ref{SM-tab:model_details}. If
model orography was available in the \texttt{orog} variable, it was used; if
not, the orography of the historical runs of CNRM-CM6-1 (ensemble r1i1p1f2) was
interpolated onto the model grid and used instead \cite{Bracegirdle_ASL_2020}.
Reanalyses were European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
reanalysis 5 (ERA5) data \cite{Hersbach_QJRMS_2020} on pressure levels. To match
the CMIP6 model characteristics, we used global ERA5 data at 00, 06, 12, and 18
UTC for each day from 1980 to 1999, interpolated to
1$^{\circ}$$\times$1$^{\circ}$ resolution. 

\subsection*{Calculation of convective parameters}

Convective parameters were calculated as described for the proxy of Raupach et
al., 2023 \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}, for each CMIP6 dataset at its native
resolution and for downscaled ERA5 data. For each CMIP6 model, annual and
seasonal statistics were calculated, then all statistics were interpolated onto
a 1$^{\circ}$$\times$1$^{\circ}$ grid for comparison.

\subsection*{Application of hail proxies}

We applied three hail-specific instability-shear proxies to CMIP6 and ERA5 data:
Raupach, Eccel, and SHIP. The proxies were, respectively, a modified version of
the proxy in Raupach et al., 2023 with ``extra conditions'' to remove false
positives (Raupach) \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}, that of Eccel et al., 2012
\cite{Eccel_IJC_2012}, and a threshold of 0.1 on the Significant Hail Parameter
(SHIP) \cite{SPC_SHIP}. The modifications made to the Raupach proxy are detailed
in Supplementary Material Section \ref{SM-sec:proxy-update}. Other proxies were
tested but excluded from this study because they produced unrealistically many
or too few hail-prone days in comparison with the other proxies (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:historical_all_proxies}). The Raupach proxy without extra
conditions produced similar results to the Raupach proxy with extra conditions
(Supplementary Figures \ref{SM-fig:historical_all_proxies},
\ref{SM-fig:Raupach_extra_conds}).

\subsection*{Per-degree framework}

The historical period used for each model was 1980--1999. The epochs that
represented 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} warming compared to the historical period
were determined per model using 20-year running means of monthly global average
temperature anomalies (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:epochs}).

\subsection*{Calculation of drivers}

For each hail proxy ingredient, de-biased versions of the 3 \degr{} epoch were
calculated using \texttt{python-cmethods} \cite{Schwertfeger_2024} using the
quantile-mapping method with 100 quantiles and the historical period as the
baseline.
