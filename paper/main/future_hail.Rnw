\abstract{Hailstorms cause significant damage across the globe, but changes to
hailstorms in a warming climate are not well quantified. Here, we applied
four hail proxies to an ensemble of eight global model projections to quantify
changes in the frequency of hail-prone conditions worldwide. As a sensitivity
study we calculated the effects of those changes on hail risk for 26 crop types.
In projections with 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} of mean global warming, hail-prone
conditions shifted poleward, with decreases in hail frequency across the
mid-latitudes and increases in colder regions. In general, hail-prone frequency
was projected to decrease in summer and increase in winter. Accordingly, if
exposure and vulnerability are held fixed, the projections indicate increases in
hail risk for winter crops and decreases in risk for summer crops.}

Hailstorms are a form of extreme weather that causes significant damage to
physical assets including crops. Hail and the storms that produce it are
expected to be affected by anthropogenic global warming, yet regional studies
using observations or projections show geographical inhomogeneities and there
remains high uncertainty on the details of any changes \cite{Allen_2018,
Brimelow_2018, Raupach_NREE_2021}. Globally, hail observations are scarce
\cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, meaning global climatologies generally rely on
satellite data \cite{Cecil_JC_2012,Bang_JAMC_2019} or examination of
environmental conditions in reanalyses using hail proxies \cite{Prein_WCE_2018}.
Here, we produced global projections of future hail hazard using hail proxies
applied to model output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)
\cite{Eyring_GMD_2016} in a per-degree framework, and used them to analyse
projected changes in hail frequency and resulting changes in hail risk to crops.

Because hailstorms are hard to observe and model owing to their small spatial
size and relative rarity \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, proxies that detect
hail-prone atmospheric conditions are often used in climatological studies. Hail
proxies rely on detecting the atmospheric ``ingredients'' required for hail to
form. Hailstones form by accretion of supercooled liquid water onto ice embryos
suspended in the updraft of a thunderstorm, until they become too heavy to
support, after which they fall while melting on their descent through warmer air
\cite{Knight_2001, Fraile_AR_2003}. Hailstorm ingredients are usually considered
to include, at a minimum, atmospheric instability, for a thunderstorm with
strong updrafts that can support hail growth to form \cite{Brooks_AR_2003}, and
vertical wind shear (differences in horizontal wind by height) to ``organise''
the storm \cite{Brooks_AR_2013} and influence hailstone trajectories
\cite{Dennis_JAS_2017, Lin_JAS_2022}. Instability--shear hail proxies are common
\cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}. Proxies suffer, however, from the ``initiation
problem'', in that storms rarely initiate even in storm-prone conditions
\cite{Sherwood_MWR_1999, Tippett_CCCR_2015, Raupach_MWR_2023}.

Climate change is expected to affect the ingredients for hailstorms and thus the
frequency and severity of hailstorms themselves \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}. A
thermodynamic expectation is of three offsetting effects: first, increased
instability owing to a larger saturation deficit in a warmer atmosphere
\cite{Seeley_GRL_2015} leading to more storm initiation and stronger updrafts
that could support larger hailstones; second, increased melting of hailstones
owing to a warmer troposphere \cite{Prein_NCC_2020}, thus leading to a reduction
(or elimination \cite{Mahoney_NCC_2012}) of surface hail frequency; and third,
an overall decrease in vertical wind shear \cite{Brooks_AR_2013} that is often
outweighed by changes in instability \cite{Trapp_GRL_2009, Allen_JC_2014b} or
may not apply locally \cite{Diffenbaugh_PNAS_2013, Radler_npjCAS_2019}. The
broad thermodynamic expectation is thus of a reduction in surface hail frequency
combined with an increase in severity when hail does reach the Earth's surface
\cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}. However, regional studies show large geographical
heterogeneity in trends in hail frequency, owing in part to offsetting in
these climate change effects and in part to dynamical changes meaning that
ingredient changes are not spatially uniform, while hail severity is generally
expected to increase \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}.

Here, we applied four hail proxies to an ensemble of eight global projections
from CMIP6, to examine projections of the frequency of hail-prone conditions
globally. We used a per-degree framework \cite{Lepore_EF_2021} for simpler
comparisons between models. As a sensitivity study, we investigated the effects
of projected changes on hail-prone proportions of time-inveriant crop growing
seasons for 26 different crops. For details of the simulations and proxies used,
refer to ``Online methods'' and the supplementary information. Our work shows
that, generally, hailstorm frequency is projected to shift poleward, with
decreases in warmer environments but increases in cooler environments in future,
driven primarily by changes in convective instability. Our sensitivity analysis
shows that the projected changes would increase hail occurrence risk to winter
crops, while decreasing occurrence risk for summer crops.

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection*{Comparison to ERA5 for the historical period}

Figure \ref{fig:cmip_era_comparison} shows a comparison between the multimodel,
multi-proxy mean of annual hail-prone days for the CMIP6 models, and the
multi-proxy mean of annual hail-prone days for the ERA5 reanalysis, for
1980--1999. While individual CMIP6 models produced a wide range of absolute
values of hail-prone days (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:historical_annual_means}), the locations of hail hotspots agreed
well between reanalysis and models. The models MPI-ESM1-2-HR and EC-Earth
produced similar numbers of hail-prone days to ERA5, while MIROC6, CMCC-CM2-SR5,
and CMCC-ESM2 showed moderately more and CNRM-CM6-1 and GISS-E2-1-G showed
significantly more hail-prone days than ERA5. There were also differences across
the selected hail proxies, with the Significant Hail Parameter (SHIP)
\cite{SPC_SHIP} producing the fewest, and the modified proxy of Raupach et al.,
2023 \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023} without extra conditions (RaupachNEC) producing the
greatest number of hail-prone days, respectively. Different proxies highlighted
similar geographical regions but differed in magnitudes of hail-prone days.
Given the models produced geographical agreement but differences in absolute
numbers of hail-prone days, we focus on changes in multi-proxy, multimodel means
in the rest of our analyses.

    (1980-1999) at 1 $\times$ 1 $^{\circ}$ resolution.}
    \label{fig:cmip_era_comparison}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Case studies of hail-prone day anomalies}
\label{sec:cases}

Monthly multi-proxy mean anomalies in hail-prone days derived using ERA5
reanalysis showed higher values for months with known occurrences of damaging
hailstorms. The proxies produced higher than climatological average numbers of
hail-prone days for February and March 2015 in northern and central India
(Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:anoms_India_2015}), regions that were affected
by hailstorms that caused major losses to wheat crops in this period
\citep{Chattopadhyay_Mausam_2017, Singh_CS_2017}. Similarly, the proxies
highlighted areas of central and southern Europe as particularly hail-prone in
June 2022 (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:anoms_Europe_2022}), when the
passage of two low-pressure systems caused hailstorm outbreaks across these
regions \citep{Pucik_2023} that broke records for insured losses in France
\citep{Soyka_2023}. The proxies also identified April 2015 and October 2022 as
unusually hail-prone months in northeast India and western France, respectively;
there were hailstorms reported in both regions during these respective months
\cite{Chattopadhyay_Mausam_2017, Pucik_2023}. These case-study results increase
our confidence in the ability of the multi-proxy mean to identify hail-prone
conditions worldwide, despite the individual proxies having been trained using
data from Australia \citep{Raupach_MWR_2023}, Italy \citep{Eccel_IJC_2012}, and
the United States \citep{SPC_SHIP}.

\subsection*{Changes in hail-prone days with warming}

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/main/change_annual_hail_days_abs}
    \caption{\textbf{Hail-prone conditions shift under warming projections.}
    Multi-proxy, multimodel mean changes in annual hail-prone days for 2 \degr{}
    (a) and 3 \degr{} (b) of global warming. Stippling shows regions in which at
    least 50\% of the model/proxy combinations agreed with the sign of the mean
    difference and also showed significant differences in the mean ($p < 0.05$
    on a t-test on two related samples).}
    \label{fig:future_changes_hail_days}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:future_changes_hail_days} shows multimodel, multi-proxy mean
changes in annual hail-prone days for 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} of global warming,
respectively. These changes are shown as relative differences zoomed to selected
land areas in Figures \ref{fig:future_changes_regional_1} and
\ref{fig:future_changes_regional_2}. Changes were similar between the two
epochs, with a general increase in the change magnitude in the 3 \degr{}
scenario. Changes generally agreed across the Raupach proxies and SHIP, while
the pure instability--shear proxy of Eccel \cite{Eccel_IJC_2012} produced
contrasting increases across the tropics (Supplementary Figures
\ref{SM-fig:hail_diffs_2C} and \ref{SM-fig:hail_diffs_3C}). The mean changes
show an overall poleward shift of hail-prone conditions under both warming
scenarios, with increases in hail-prone condition frequency projected across
land areas in central-north Asia, New Zealand's south island, Tasmania and the
southeast of Australia, North America north of about 50\degg{} N, South America
in the southern Pampas and west to the Andes, Europe north of about 60\degg{} N
and in the vicinity of the Alps and southeast of the Black Sea, North Africa
over the eastern part of the Sahara, and a very small region in eastern South
Africa. Decreases in hail-prone day frequency were projected in southeast
coastal areas of India and China, connecting in a band across mainland Southeast
Asia, northern Australia, the southeast United States and Mexico, the northern
region of South America and east of the Andes between about 10\degg{} S and
30\degg{} S, the North Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Africa, and most of
Africa south of 15\degg{} N. Seasonal analyses showed that the increases are
concentrated in the cold season and decreases in the warm season (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:hail_changes_by_season}).

\subsection*{Projected changes in proxy ingredients}

Projections of storm-relevant properties showed almost uniform increases in
convective instability, with increases in extreme values of convective available
potential energy (CAPE) and lifted index (LI), and increasing convective
inhibition that may lead to more explosive development of severe storms
(Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_1}). Projections in
extremes in 0-6 km bulk wind shear (S06) showed decreases (mixed increases) in
the northern (southern) hemisphere (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_1}). Temperature-related ingredients increased
as expected in the warmer scenarios (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_2}). 

\subsection*{Drivers of the projected changes}

Figure \ref{fig:drivers} shows the main drivers of projected changes in this
study, shown as the difference between projected changes and changes when the
future values for single ingredients were de-biased. The ingredients driving the
changes depended on the proxy. Overall, increases in hail-prone environment
frequency were driven by instability increases, while reductions in hail-prone
environment frequency were driven by temperature-related ingredients. The sums
of changes across de-biased ingredients were close to the projected changes
where no ingredients were de-biased, indicating that these results explain most
of the projected changes, with the small differences that remain likely related
to interactions between ingredients. The large differences between the Eccel
proxy and the other proxies were caused by the instability--shear proxy reacting
to increases in instability without explicitly accounting for temperature
changes. Changes in SHIP were driven mainly by changes in the most-unstable
mixing ratio. In the Raupach proxies, increases in hail-prone days owing to
instability increases are offset by changes in melting level height and
$T_{500}$.

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/main/sig_drivers}
    \caption{\textbf{The main drivers of the projected changes.} All drivers are
    shown in Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:drivers}. All plots are multimodel
    means. Plots show the difference in hail prone days between historical and
    the 3C epoch for unchanged ingredients, minus the difference with the given
    ingredient de-biased in the 3C epoch. Red (blue) areas show where an
    ingredient added to (subtracted from) the projected change. Ingredients
    shown here are melting level height (MLH, a-d), mixed-layer CAPE (MLCAPE,
    e-h), most-unstable mixing ratio (MUMR, i-l), and temperature at 500 hPa
    (T500, m-p). ``Sum'' (q-t) shows sums across changes from all de-biased
    ingredients (column sums from Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:drivers}) and
    ``Ref'' (u-x) shows the projected changes per proxy when no ingredients were
    de-biased. Columns show hail proxies and the colour scale is in annual hail
    days.}
    \label{fig:drivers}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Changes in hail-prone proportions of cropping periods}

Figure \ref{fig:crop_changes} shows changes in the proportion of crop growing
time considered hail-prone, for 26 crops by world region. We use a new metric,
the hail-prone proportion of cropping season (HPP, the proportion of total
cropping days considered hail prone) to measure relative hail occurrence hazard
per crop for a given location. For the historic period, the African tropics
showed particularly high hail hazard for millet, sorghum, soybeans, maize,
groundnuts/peanuts, and pulses (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:historic_crop_proportions}). Warming of 2\degr{} and 3\degr{} C was
projected to reduce HPP for these crops while increasing HPP for crops grown in
more poleward regions (Supplementary Figures \ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_2C} and
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_3C}). 

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/main/crop_changes}
    \caption{\textbf{Distributions of significant changes in hail-prone crop
    proportion (HPP) by crop, epoch, and world region}. Regions are defined as
    in Figure \ref{fig:future_changes_regional_1}. Changes are multimodel,
    multi-proxy mean changes in hail-prone proportion of cropping season (HPP),
    shown as a percentage of the multimodel, multi-proxy mean historical HPP.
    Significant changes are those for which at least 50\% of the model/proxy
    combinations agreed with the sign of the mean difference and also showed
    significant differences in the mean ($p < 0.05$ using Welch's t-test).
    Coloured boxes show interquartile ranges, whiskers show 10th-90th percentile
    ranges.}
    \label{fig:crop_changes}
\end{figure*}

In Africa, all crops were projected to experience fewer hail-prone days, with
regional increases not statistically significant (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_africa}). In Asia, (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_asia}), there were a range of responses, with
decreasing hail hazard in India and generally in China. Increases in HPP were
projected across the north for barley, fodder grasses, grapes/vine,
rapeseed/canola, rye, and wheat. Maize was projected to experience a greater
hail hazard in southeastern China but a lesser hazard in the northeast, while
wheat and rapeseed/canola showed strong increases in HPP in northeastern China.
In Europe, most non-significant changes were decreases, but significant changes
indicated increases in HPP for barley, fodder grasses, grapes/vine, maize,
potatoes, pulses, rapeseed/canola, rye, wheat, and other annual and perennial
crops. The significant increases were generally concentrated in a zonal band at
around 60\degg{}N and in regions around the Alps in Western Europe, an area to
the southeast of the Black Sea, and in southern Iran (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_europe}). Increases in HPP for rye were heavily
concentrated in Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and the adjoining areas of Russia. In
North America, there were significant increases for barley and rye in
particular, with regional increases in HPP for these crops across the central
and eastern USA. For other crops, there were generally decreases in HPP
projected in the southeast, with increases projected in the northeast and across
northern Canada (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_north_america}).
In Oceania overall, barley was projected to have increased hail hazard, albeit
with a large range in projected changes, while all other crops showed projected
decreases in HPP. Significant decreases in HPP were concentrated in Australia's
northeast, while significant increases were concentrated in a small region of
southeast Australia and the South Island of New Zealand (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_oceania}). In South America, all crops were projected
to have decreased overall hazard. However, regional changes show statistically
significant increases in HPP for several crops, for example maize and potatoes,
in a region of the southern Pampas and west to the Andes (Supplementary Figure
\ref{SM-fig:crop_changes_south_america}).

Monthly changes for point locations (Supplementary Figures
\ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_af}--\ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_india}) highlight that the
crops with the greatest projected increases in risk were those with winter
cropping periods, while those with the greatest reductions in risk were those
that grow across summer periods. For example, in China, potatoes were projected
to have decreased risk during the cropping season of May to September, while
wheat was projected to have increased risk during its season from October to
April (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_as}). These plots also show
that uncertainty was higher for the summer months, with greater inter-model
spread and with the sign of the change disagreeing between proxies for some
months. Returning to the two case studies shown earlier, a region of southern
Europe near the Alps showed an overall increase in hail-prone proportion of
cropping season for potatoes, rye, and wheat, with proxy disagreement across the
summer months and agreement on increases from October to April (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_eu}). In India for rice, wheat and maize, there
were non-significant increases in hail-prone cropping season proportion across
the southern flank of the Himalaya, but decreases further south (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:crop_lines_india}).

\section*{Discussion}

Our projections show broad poleward shifts in hail-prone condition occurrence
frequency under 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} of warming, with, generally, decreases
in summer hail-prone day frequency and smaller increases in winter. The
increases are driven by changes in instability and offset by increases in
temperature. A sensitivity analysis on 26 crop types shows that winter crops are
most susceptable to increases in hail hazard while summer crops are most likely
to experience a reduction in hail hazard.

Our projections show a global analysis of changes in hail hazard frequency under
climate change. To put them in context, here we show where they agree with or
contradict previous results, by region. In Asia, our results match past
decreases in hail occurrence found in stations concentrated in China's east from
1980-2012 \cite{Xie_GRL_2008, Li_JC_2016, Zhang_SR_2017}, but contradict past
decreases in hail events reported in Mongolia (1993-2013)
\cite{Lkhamjav_APJAS_2017}. In Australia, our significant projections continue
observed trends: hail-prone conditions in reanalysis (1979-2021) have increased
in the southeast and southwest of the country with decreases across the north
and centre \cite{Raupach_npjCAS_2023} (our non-significant projected decreases
in frequency in the southwest contradict these past trends). Projections for
small regions in the southeast have shown no trends in hail losses for doubled
CO2 concentrations \cite{McMaster_CC_1999}. A decrease in frequency in point
locations in southwest Victoria was projected when comparing 1980-2000 to
2040-2060 \cite{Niall_IJC_2005}, although the decreases were based on decreases
in instability that do not agree with more recent analyses \cite{Allen_JC_2014}.

In North America, past trends show a mixed picture \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, but
our projections align with some previous results: hailstorm frequency increased
in Alberta, Canada from 1982-1993 compared to 1977-1982 \cite{Etkin_IJC_1999},
there increases in frequency the central Rockies with overall USA decreases
close to 2000 (although increases were noted in the high plains and southeast,
contradicting our results) \cite{Changnon_JC_2000}, and a poleward shift was
found in hail reports since 2000 in the Eastern United States
\cite{Liu_ERL_2024}. Other studies on past trends in the United States found no
significant trends \cite{Allen_EJSSM_2015, Allen_JAMES_2015, Barrett_MWR_2015}.
Regional projections for North America comparing 1971-2000 to 2041-2070 have
shown decreases in frequency overall and especially in the east and southeast
\cite{Brimelow_NCC_2017} and a near elimination of surface hail in Colorado
\cite{Mahoney_NCC_2012}, agreeing with our projections. Severe hail frequency in
North America is generally projected to increase \cite{Trapp_JC_2019,
Childs_WCS_2020}, although summer decreases in severe hail frequency in the east
are projected \cite{Trapp_JC_2019}. In South America, there are few trend
studies and no other projections \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}; in Argentina our
significant projections contradict observed decreases in the centre and east
over 1960-2008 \cite{Mezher_AR_2012}, although there is geographical variability
in observed trends in Argentina \cite{Mezher_AR_2012} and on the
Brazil/Argentina border \cite{Beal_AR_2020}.

In Europe, our results showed significant projected increases to the north of
the Alps, agreeing with past increases in Switzerland in insurance data
(1949-1993) \cite{Willemse_1995}, northern Switzerland (1980-2014)
\cite{Madonna_AR_2018} and northern and southern Switzerland (1959-2022)
\cite{Wilhelm_NHESS_2024} in reanalyses, and Southern Germany (1986-2004) in
insurance records \cite{Kunz_IJC_2009}. Much of the rest of southern and central
Europe showed non-significant changes in our analysis, which aligns with the
wide variety of observed trends and corresponding high uncertainty for both
trends and projections in this region \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}. In Germany,
where our results were non-significant, regional projections to 2050 have shown
increases in hail-related weather types \cite{Kapsch_JGRA_2012} and an increase
in hail potential in the northwest and south \cite{Mohr_JGRA_2015}. Likewise in
central Italy our results were non-significant while a previous regional
projection to 2040 showed an increase in annual hail frequency
\cite{Piani_NHESS_2005}. Increased melting in Atlantic France is projected to
reduce hailstone numbers \cite{Dessens_AR_2015}. Severe hail frequency in Europe
is generally projected to increase by 2100 \cite{Radler_npjCAS_2019} with model
disagreement on instability trends over the United Kingdom
\cite{Sanderson_IJC_2015}.

It is interesting to compare our results to those for the broader class of
severe convective storms, which includes thunderstorms that do not produce hail.
Severe storm conditions are generally projected to increase in frequency with
global warming \cite{Lepore_EF_2021}. Our results show that changes in hail
conditions may differ because of the importance of increasing hailstone melt in
warmer conditions, which is especially important for smaller hail
\cite{Pruppacher_2010}. As an illustration of this effect, generally in the mid
to high tropics the Eccel proxy shows an increase where the Raupach proxies and
SHIP show decreases. This is explained by the Eccel proxy being similar to an
instability-shear severe storm proxy while the non-Eccel proxies take changes in
temperature explicitly into account. 

In our work we have used CMIP6 projections that include changes in atmospheric
circulations, thus avoiding a purely thermodynamic approach. However, we note
that there is generally low confidence in how changes in dynamics affect extreme
events \cite{IPCC_2021_WGI_Ch_11}, and for the broader class of severe
convective storms changes in reanalysis periods \cite{Taszarek_npj_2021} can be
of different sign to projected changes \cite{Lepore_EF_2021}, which may be
partly explained by uncertainty introduced by changes in atmospheric
circulation. Proxies trained in one region cannot be assumed to be perfectly
applicable globally since storm properties differ by location
\cite{Taszarek_JC_2020, Brooks_AR_2003, Raupach_MWR_2023}. However, the Raupach
proxies are specifically designed to take spatial variability in storm
conditions into account by using the melting level height, and have been shown
to perform reasonably across the Australian continent which contains a wide
variety of storm environments \cite{Raupach_npjCAS_2023}, and the multi-proxy
means were able to identify particularly hail-prone conditions in case studies
in areas in which the proxies used here were not trained. Although we show proxy
results globally, we note the proxies used were trained using land-based reports
\cite{Raupach_MWR_2023, Eccel_IJC_2012} and there is uncertainty in the
occurrence of hail in maritime storms \citep{Knight_2001}.

A limitation to our approach is that the cropping periods we consider are
stationary in time and relatively coarse, so our analysis of crop changes should
be taken as a sensitivity study rather than projections of changes in crop
damage or yield. Suitable growing regions and cropping periods may also shift
with warming \cite{Franke_GCB_2022}. It is also important to note that the
timing of hail events within the broad cropping season strongly influences
possible crop damage \cite{Dhillon_CJPS_2021}. Future analyses should take
projected changes in cropping season and growth stages into account. 

Our results show large areas of projected reductions in hail-prone day
frequency. However, given proxy limitations we do not examine changes in
hailstorm severity or hailstone size. Projected increases in atmospheric
instability (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:ingredients_changes_1}) in regions
in which sufficient moisture is available would generally be expected to
increase generation of large hailstones that could survive melting to the
surface \cite{Raupach_NREE_2021}, meaning that even where frequency is projected
to reduce, severity may increase. A coincident decrease of small hail and
increase of large hail aligns with hail size end-of-century projections for the
USA \cite{Gensini_npjCAS_2024}. It is likely that global severe hail projections
would differ significantly from the ``any hail'' projections shown here.

\subsection*{Data}

A filtering approach was used to select models from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) \cite{Eyring_GMD_2016}. We selected
models that contained variables required to calculate convective indices: air
temperature at the surface (\texttt{tas}) and by model level (\texttt{ta}), wind
vectors at the surface (\texttt{uas} and \texttt{vas}) and by level (\texttt{ua}
and \texttt{va}), specific humidity at the surface (\texttt{huss}) and by level
(\texttt{hus}), and surface pressure (\texttt{ps}). We filtered for models with
a temporal resolution at least as fine as six-hourly (those with ``table IDs''
of \texttt{3hr} or \texttt{6hrLev}), and models that were available for both
historical and SSP5-8.5 experiments (``experiment IDs'' of \texttt{historical}
or \texttt{ssp585}). Further, the models had to be available in the National
Computational Infrastructure (NCI) node of the Earth System Grid Federation
(ESGF), and had to cover the required epochs. The resulting CMIP6 models, that
we used here, are detailed in Supplementary Table \ref{SM-tab:model_details}. If
model orography was available in the \texttt{orog} variable, it was used; if
not, the orography of the historical runs of CNRM-CM6-1 (ensemble r1i1p1f2) was
interpolated onto the model grid and used instead \cite{Bracegirdle_ASL_2020}.
Reanalyses were European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
reanalysis 5 (ERA5) data \cite{Hersbach_QJRMS_2020} on pressure levels
\cite{ERA5_data}. To match the CMIP6 model characteristics, we used global ERA5
data at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC for each day from 1980 to 1999, interpolated to
1$^{\circ}$$\times$1$^{\circ}$ resolution. 

\subsection*{Calculation of convective parameters}

Convective parameters were calculated as described for the proxy of Raupach et
al., 2023 \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}, for each CMIP6 dataset at its native
resolution and for downscaled ERA5 data. For each CMIP6 model, annual and
seasonal statistics were calculated, then all statistics were interpolated onto
a 1$^{\circ}$$\times$1$^{\circ}$ grid for comparison.

\subsection*{Application of hail proxies}

We applied four hail-specific instability-shear proxies to CMIP6 and ERA5 data:
Raupach, RaupachNEC, Eccel, and SHIP. The proxies were, respectively, a modified
version of the proxy in Raupach et al., 2023 with (Raupach) and without
(RaupachNEC) ``extra conditions'' to remove false positives
\cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}, that of Eccel et al., 2012 \cite{Eccel_IJC_2012}, and a
threshold of 0.1 on the Significant Hail Parameter (SHIP) \cite{SPC_SHIP}. The
modifications made Raupach and RaupachNEC are detailed in Supplementary Material
Section \ref{SM-sec:proxy-update}. Other proxies were tested but excluded from
this study. The proxies of Kunz 2007 \cite{Kunz_NHESS_2007} and Mohr and Kunz,
2013 \cite{Mohr_AR_2013} produced unrealistically many hail-prone days in
tropical regions for which they were not trained \cite{Raupach_MWR_2023}, and a
threshold of 0.5 on SHIP, as has been used in other studies for severe hail
\cite{Prein_WCE_2018}, was found to produce too few hail-prone days in
comparison with the other proxies designed for hail of any size (Supplementary
Figure \ref{SM-fig:historical_all_proxies}).

\subsection*{Per-degree framework}

The historical period used for each model was 1980--1999. The epochs that
represented 2 \degr{} and 3 \degr{} warming compared to the historical period
were determined per model using 20-year running means of monthly global average
temperature anomalies (Supplementary Figure \ref{SM-fig:epochs}).

\subsection*{Calculation of drivers}

For each hail proxy ingredient, de-biased versions of the 3 \degr{} epoch were
calculated using \texttt{python-cmethods} v2.3.0 \cite{Schwertfeger_2024} using
the quantile-mapping method with 100 quantiles and the historical period as the
baseline.
